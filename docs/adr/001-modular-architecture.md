# ADR-001: Modular Architecture with Feature-Based Organization

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-01-18  
**Deciders**: Development Team

## Context
Legacy codebase had 73+ duplicate interfaces, 542+ useState calls scattered across components, and 325+ unstructured imports creating maintenance issues.

## Decision
Adopt feature-based modular architecture:
- `/shared/*` for reusable code (types, UI, hooks, API)
- `/features/*` for domain-specific functionality 
- `/app/*` for routing, providers, guards
- Single source of truth for types in `shared/types/`

## Consequences
‚úÖ **Positive**: Clear boundaries, reduced duplication, better testability  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Negative**: Initial migration effort, learning curve for team  
üìã **Mitigation**: Gradual migration, clear guidelines, code review enforcement
